  {{< blocks/feature icon="fa-dollar-sign" title="Lower cluster costs" >}}
    <p class="font-weight-light">Karpenter looks for opportunities to remove under-utilized nodes, replace expensive nodes with cheaper alternatives, or combine pods from multiple smaller nodes onto larger, more efficient ones. It is fully compatible with preemptible compute resource types which offer deep savings.</p>

  {{< blocks/feature icon="fa-wrench" title="Minimize operational overhead" >}}
    <p class="font-weight-light">Karpenter doesn't require configuring multiple, overlapping Kubernetes or cloud provider systems according to complex best practices. Works with many built-in Kubernetes scheduling constraints. Comes with a set of opinionated defaults in a single, declarative `Provisioner` resource which can easily be customized</p>

<h2 class="mx-auto font-weight-bolder">How It Works</h2>
<p class="h5 mx-auto mt-5 col-8 font-weight-light">
  Karpenter works by observing the aggregate resource requests of unscheduled pods and makes decisions to launch and terminate nodes to minimize scheduling latencies and infrastructure cost. Karpenter works with any Kubernetes cluster running in any environment including all major cloud providers and on-premises environments.
